# 🧠 AI-Powered Skin Cancer Classifier

This project aims to develop an AI model that classifies skin cancer lesions as benign or malignant using NIH imaging data and clinical data. Early detection of skin cancer is critical, and this model can help provide fast, non-invasive assessments to assist medical professionals and the public.
